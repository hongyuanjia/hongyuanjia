# Zone HVAC Design Objects

1. Set design specifications of outdoor air
2. Set zone, system and plant sizing parameters

# Zone HVAC Controls and Thermostats

1. Set zone thermostats

# Zone HVAC Forced Air Units

1. Zone HVAC components here should directly correct to zones and cannot connect
to Zone HVAC Air Loop Terminal Units.

# Zone HVAC Radiative/Convective Units

1. Components here do not use normal zone thermostats but use their own schedule
to set zone setpoints

# Zone HVAC Air Loop Terminal Units

1. Components here are just used to distribute air flow to zones and can be used
together with other coils.
