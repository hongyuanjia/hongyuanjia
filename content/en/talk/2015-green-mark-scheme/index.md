The Green Mark Scheme develops rapidly and gets wide acceptance in areas
outside Singapore since it was launched by the Singapore Building and
Construction Authority (BCA) in 2005. Now, it has specific published versions
for use in China. Overviews of green building scheme development in both
countries were made. An comparison analysis is made between the BCA Green
Mark International for Residential Buildings for Use in China (version
RB/1.0, referred to as GMI RB/1.0) and Assessment Standard for Green Building
(GB/T 50378-2014, referred to as GBL 2014) in terms of rating levels, rating
methods, categories, credit settings, and etc. Both two schemes put
significant attention to utilization of sustainable energy. As Singapore has
a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive seasons, high temperature
and humidity, energy efficiency features account for a large proportion in
the GMI RB/1.0. However, it is found that, due to the insufficient
consideration of the climate and geographical conditions in China, some
requirements in GMI RB/1.0 are extremely difficult or unlikely to achieve for
development in China. The reasons are analyzed based on the development
submitting both GM certification and GBL in Chongqing, China.
