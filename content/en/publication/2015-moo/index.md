    Several conflicting criteria exist in building design optimization,
    especially energy consumption and indoor environment thermal performance.
    This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization model that can
    assist designers in green building design. The Pareto solution was used to
    obtain a set of optimal solutions for building design optimization, and
    uses an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) as
    a theoretical basis for building design multi-objective optimization model.
    Based on the simulation data on energy consumption and indoor thermal
    comfort, the study also used a simulation-based improved back-propagation
    (BP) network which is optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) to characterize
    building behavior, and then establishes a GA\textendash BP network model
    for rapidly predicting the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort
    status of residential buildings; Third, the building design multi-objective
    optimization model was established by using the GA\textendash BP network as
    a fitness function of the multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II);
    Finally, a case study is presented with the aid of the multi-objective
    approach in which dozens of potential designs are revealed for a typical
    building design in China, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal
    comfort and energy consumption.
