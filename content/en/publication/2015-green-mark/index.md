abstract: >
    The Green Mark Scheme develops rapidly and gets wide acceptance in areas
    outside Singapore since it was launched by the Singapore Building and
    Construction Authority (BCA) in 2005. Now, it has specific published
    versions for use in China. Overviews of green building scheme development
    in both countries were made. An comparison analysis is made between the
    BCA Green Mark International for Residential Buildings for Use in China
    (version RB/1.0, referred to as GMI RB/1.0) and Assessment Standard for
    Green Building (GB/T 50378-2014, referred to as GBL 2014) in terms of
    rating levels, rating methods, categories, credit settings, and etc. Both
    two schemes put significant attention to utilization of sustainable
    energy. As Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive
    seasons, high temperature and humidity, energy efficiency features account
    for a large proportion in the GMI RB/1.0. However, it is found that, due
    to the insufficient consideration of the climate and geographical
    conditions in China, some requirements in GMI RB/1.0 are extremely
    difficult or unlikely to achieve for development in China. The reasons are
    analyzed based on the development submitting both GM certification and GBL
    in Chongqing, China.
