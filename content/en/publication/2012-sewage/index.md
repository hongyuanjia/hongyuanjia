abstract: >
    The heat transfer mechanism of sewage in the pipes was analyzed. It was
    found that the heat transfer was associated with a variety of factors and
    the effects of the air above the sewage on its temperature varied with
    seasons. The all- day temperature of sewage in pipes of one residential
    quarter in Chongqing was measured by a thermocouple thermometer. And the
    reasons oftemperature variation were analyzed. The temperature variation of
    sewage in different sites was studied by using daily range
    temperatureï¼Œstandard deviation and etc. The reasons were analyzed as well.
    Based on the conclusion, the selection ofthe intake point ofsewage source
    heat pump systemwas discussed.
