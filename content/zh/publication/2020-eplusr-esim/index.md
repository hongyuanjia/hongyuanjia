abstract: >
   Parametric analysis using EnergyPlus has been a powerful approach to enable
   investigation of environmental and energy performance for different design and
   retrofit design alternatives. However, the absence of streamlined workflow
   integrating model editing, simulation and output extracting raises problems in
   the productivity of parametric analysis. This paper presents a newly developed
   framework for conducting parametric analysis using EnergyPlus via the
   programming language R package called "eplusr". The proposed framework, with a
   data-centric design philosophy, focuses on not only EnergyPlus model editing but
   also parametric simulation output data extraction and analysis. It provides
   rich-featured interfaces to query and modify models programmatically and a
   simple yet flexible and extensible prototype of conducting parametric
   simulations and collecting all results in one go. The paper discusses the
   philosophy behind the framework, its architecture and core capabilities, and
   uses simple tasks to demonstrate the streamlined workflow of conducting
   parametric analysis in R.
