    Radiant heating and cooling systems have significant energy-saving potential
    and are gaining popularity in commercial buildings. The main aim of the
    experimental study reported here was to characterize the behavior of radiant
    cooling systems in a typical office environment, including the effect of
    ceiling fans on stratification, the variation in comfort conditions from
    perimeter to core, control on operative temperature vs. air temperature and
    the effect of carpet on cooling capacity. The goal was to limit both the
    first cost and the perceived risk associated with such systems. Two types of
    radiant systems, the radiant ceiling panel (RCP) system and the radiant slab
    (RS) system, were investigated. The experiments were carried out in one of
    the test cells that constitute the FLEXLAB test facility at the Lawrence
    Berkeley National Laboratory in March and April 2016. In total, ten test
    cases (five for RCP and five for RS) were performed, covering a range of
    operational conditions. In cooling mode, the air temperature stratification
    is relatively small in the RCP, with a maximum value of 1.6 K. The observed
    stratification effect was significantly greater in the RS, twice as much as
    that in the RCP. The maximum increase in dry bulb temperature in the
    perimeter zone due to solar radiation was 1.2 K for RCP and 0.9 K for RS
    \textendash{} too small to have a significant impact on thermal comfort. The
    use of ceiling fans was able to reduce any excess stratification and provide
    better indoor comfort, if required. The use of thin carpet requires a 1 K
    lower supply chilled water temperature to compensate for the added thermal
    resistance, somewhat reducing the opportunities for water-side free cooling
    and increasing the risk of condensation. In both systems, the difference
    between the room operative temperature and the room air temperature is small
    when the cooling loads are met by the radiant systems. This makes it
    possible to use the air temperature to control the radiant systems in lieu
    of the operative temperature, reducing both first cost and maintenance
    costs.
