  abstract = {The Green Mark Scheme develops rapidly and gets wide acceptance in areas outside Singapore since it was launched by the Singapore Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in 2005. Now, it has specific published versions for use in China. Overviews of green building scheme development in both countries were made. An comparison analysis is made between the BCA Green Mark International for Residential Buildings for Use in China (version RB/1.0, referred to as GMI RB/1.0) and Assessment Standard for Green Building (GB/T 50378-2014, referred to as GBL 2014) in terms of rating levels, rating methods, categories, credit settings, and etc. Both two schemes put significant attention to utilization of sustainable energy. As Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive seasons, high temperature and humidity, energy efficiency features account for a large proportion in the GMI RB/1.0. However, it is found that, due to the insufficient consideration of the climate and geographical conditions in China, some requirements in GMI RB/1.0 are extremely difficult or unlikely to achieve for development in China. The reasons are analyzed based on the development submitting both GM certification and GBL in Chongqing, China.},
