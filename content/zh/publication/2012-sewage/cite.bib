  abstract = {The heat transfer mechanism of sewage in the pipes was analyzed. It was found that the heat transfer was associated with a variety of factors and the effects of the air above the sewage on its temperature varied with seasons. The all- day temperature of sewage in pipes of one residential quarter in Chongqing was measured by a thermocouple thermometer. And the reasons oftemperature variation were analyzed. The temperature variation of sewage in different sites was studied by using daily range temperatureï¼Œstandard deviation and etc. The reasons were analyzed as well. Based on the conclusion, the selection ofthe intake point ofsewage source heat pump systemwas discussed.},
