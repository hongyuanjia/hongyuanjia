abstract: >
    Building energy simulation (BES) has been widely adopted for the
    investigation of building environmental and energy performance for different
    design and retrofit alternatives. Data-driven analytics is vital for
    interpreting and analyzing BES results to reveal trends and provide useful
    insights. However, seamless integration between BES and data-driven
    analytics current does not exist. This paper presents eplusr, an R package
    for conducting data-driven analytics with EnergyPlus. The R package is
    cross-platform and distributed using CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive
    Network). With a data-centric design philosophy, the proposed framework
    focuses on better and more seamless integration between BES and data-driven
    analytics. It provides structured inputs/outputs format that can be easily
    piped into data analytics workflows. The framework also provides an
    infrastructure to bring portable and reusable computational environment for
    building energy modeling to facilitate reproducibility research.
