abstract: >
    Yangtze River Basin has a unique climate. It has hot summer, and cold
    winter season with high humidity all-round the year.. In such a climate,
    understanding building thermal behavior is essential for creating
    energy-efficient indoor thermal environments. An energy flow diagram has
    been made to show the relationship among the main factors of built
    environment design and operation such as "heat gains/losses"-
    "cool-ing/heating loads"- "cooling/heating supply" and "energy
    consumption". Analysis was done on the analytical concept of each factor,
    principles of current building technol-ogies and their applications in the
    Yangtze River Basin. Simulations were carried out to characterize thermal
    behavior of typical residential buildings in the Yangtze River Basin. The
    results showed that the most influencing factor is building envelope for
    cooling and infiltration for heating. Integrating natural ventilation and
    energy efficient equipment, the residential buildings could have an annual
    HVAC energy consumption of no more than 20kWh/m2.
