  abstract = {Yangtze River Basin has a unique climate. It has hot summer, and cold winter season with high humidity all-round the year.. In such a climate, understanding building thermal behavior is essential for creating energy-efficient indoor thermal environments. An energy flow diagram has been made to show the relationship among the main factors of built environment design and operation such as “heat gains/losses”- “cool-ing/heating loads”- “cooling/heating supply” and “energy consumption”. Analysis was done on the analytical concept of each factor, principles of current building technol-ogies and their applications in the Yangtze River Basin. Simulations were carried out to characterize thermal behavior of typical residential buildings in the Yangtze River Basin. The results showed that the most influencing factor is building envelope for cooling and infiltration for heating. Integrating natural ventilation and energy efficient equipment, the residential buildings could have an annual HVAC energy consumption of no more than 20kWh/m2.},
