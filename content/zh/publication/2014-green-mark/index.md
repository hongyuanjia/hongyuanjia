    Green buildings are the inevitable future trend of construction industry.
    Assessment schemes play an important role in the development of green
    buildings. The develop-ment of China Green Building Assessment Scheme,
    BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE and Singapore BCA Green Mark Scheme was introduced, and
    the comparative analysis between China Green Building Assessment Scheme
    (GB/T 50378-2014) and BCA Green Mark International (Version RB/1.0 and
    NRB/1.0) was made in respect of as-sessment method, indicators, content,
    certification levels, application and incentive policies. An actual project
    was also introduced for comparison. In the end improve-ment suggestions for
    China Green Building Assessment Scheme were given.
