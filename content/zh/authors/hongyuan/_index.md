Dr. Hongyuan Jia is a postdoctoral fellow at the [Berkeley Education Alliance for
Rearch in Singapore](http://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/). He specializes in
building performance modelling and simulation, with expertise in parametric
building modelling tooling and analysis. He is the author of R package
[eplusr](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/eplusr),
[epluspar](https://hongyuanjia.github.io/epluspar),
[epwshiftr](https://ideas-lab-nus.github.io/epwshiftr/),
[ggpsychro](https://github.com/hongyuanjia/ggpsychro) and others which provides
a rich toolkit for building energy performance assessment under climate changes
using building energy modeling.
