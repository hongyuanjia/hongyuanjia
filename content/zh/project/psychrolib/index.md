[PsychroLib](https://cran.r-project.org/package=psychrolib) is a software
library to enable the calculation of psychrometric properties of moist and dry
air.
Versions of PsychroLib are available for Python, C, C#, Fortran, R, JavaScript,
Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). psychroLib works in both
metric (SI) and imperial (IP) systems of units.

PsychroLib was first developed by D. Meyer1 and D. Thevenard. [Hongyuan Jia](/en/) and
Jason Banfelder ported it for the R programming language.

For a general overview and a list of currently available functions, please see
